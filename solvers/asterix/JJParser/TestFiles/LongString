fof(18,axiom,(documentation(physicalQuantity,"&%A PhysicalQuantity is a
measure of
some quantifiable aspect of the modeled world, such as 'the earth's
diameter' (a constant length) and 'the stress in a loaded deformable
solid' a measure of stress, which is a function of three spatial
coordinates).  All &%PhysicalQuantities are either &%ConstantQuantities
or &%FunctionQuantities.  Instances of &%ConstantQuantity are dependent
on a &%UnitOfMeasure, while instances of &%FunctionQuantity are
&%Functions that map instances of &%ConstantQuantity to other instances
of &%ConstantQuantity (e.g., &%TimeDependentQuantities are
&%FunctionQuantities). Although the name and definition of
&%PhysicalQuantity is borrowed from physics, &%PhysicalQuantities need
not be material.  Aside from the dimensions of length, time, velocity,
etc., nonphysical dimensions such as currency are also possible.
Accordingly, am
ounts of money would be instances of &%PhysicalQuantity.
&%PhysicalQuantities are distinguished from &%Numbers by the fact that the
former are associated with a
 dimension of measurement."))).
