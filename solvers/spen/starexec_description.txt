SPEN is an open source solver for checking validity of entailments 
between formulas in the symbolic heaps fragment of Separation Logic 
with recursive definitions representing complex list segments. 
For this edition, SPEN will compete on the following recursive definitions:
sll0a, nll0a, nlcl0a, skl3.

The solver is based on a method which reduces the 
entailment checking to the membership problem in tree automata, 
problem dealt using VATA. The reduction relies on checking 
satisfiability, using MINISAT, of boolean formulas built from the 
formulas in the entailment.
