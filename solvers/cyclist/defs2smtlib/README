Tool for translating Cyclist format 'defs' to SMTLIB format for SLRD.

WARNING: 
For the moment, the translation is obtained from the Cyclist satisfiability solver (slsat_check)
by modifications done on the following files:
src/slsat/slsat_check.ml
src/seplog/symheap.ml[i]

For the bench/sat files, call

./do-bench-sat.sh ../bench/sat <prefix> <root> .

For the bench/entl files, call

./do-bench-entl.sh ../bench/sat <prefix> .
