# SL-COMP'14 Benchmarks #

The **set of problems** used for SL-COMP 2014 
has been split in the following divisions
(see also Wiki and file `../divisions.html`)
* `sll0a_sat`  : satisfiability problems for symbolic heaps with list segment predicate
* `sll0a_entl` : entailment problems for symbolic heaps with list segment predicate
* `FDB_entl`   : entailment problems for symbolic heaps with composed lists
* `UDB_sat`    : satisfiability problems for symbolic heaps with inductive definitions
* `UDB_entl`   : entailment problems for symbolic heaps with inductive definitions

The files of these divisions are included in the following directories:

* `sll0a_entl` : all problems belong to division `sll0a_entl`
* `sll0a_sat`  : all problems belong to division `sll0a_sat`
* `slrd_entl`  : problems belong to divisions `FDB_entl` and `UDB_entl` 
  * `FDB_entl` : 46 problems
    * `dll-vc??.smt2`, 
    * `lss-vc??.smt2`, 
    * `nll-vc??.smt2`, 
    * `skl?-vc??.smt2`
  * `UDB_entl` : 136 problems
    * `??.tst.smt2`
    * `append_*.smt2` 
    * `dll-*.smt2`
    * `dll2-*.smt2` 
    * `*_slk*.smt2`
    * `node-*.smt2`
    * `tll-*.smt2`
    * `tree-*.smt2`
